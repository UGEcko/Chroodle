<hr>

Some environment names that may confuse you:

| ID Name | Beatsaber Name |
| ------  | -------------  |
| HalloweenEnvironment | Spooky |
| HipHopEnvironment | HipHop Mixtape |
| PyroEnvironment | Fall Out Boy |
| RocketEnvironment | Rocket League |
| BritneyEnvironment | Britney Spears |


Any environments that have a 2 in their name is the "Remastered" version. <br>
Ex: ``LinkinPark2Environment``


I have also provided ``.zip`` files for each version if you just want to download all of the environment logs instead of coming back here.

**NOTICE**: However very unlikely, there may be some imperfections in any of the environment logs. If you _do_ find any imperfections please let me know. All logs were taken from a fresh installation of Beatsaber, so there shouldn't be any extra mod objects.
