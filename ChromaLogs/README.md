# Chroma Logs
Beatsaber Versions:

- 1.29.1
- 1.34.0
- 1.37.0

<hr>

Some environment names that may confuse you:

| ID Name | Beatsaber Name |
| ------  | -------------  |
| HalloweenEnvironment | Spooky |
| HipHopEnvironment | HipHop Mixtape |
| PyroEnvironment | Fall Out Boy |
| Rocket Environment | Rocket League |


Any environments that have a 2 in their name is the "Remastered" version. 

Ex: ``LinkinPark2Environment``


I have also provided ``.zip`` files for each version if you just want to download all of the environment logs instead of coming back here.

**NOTICE**: However very unlikely, there may be some imperfections in any of the environment logs. If you _do_ find any imperfections please let me know.
